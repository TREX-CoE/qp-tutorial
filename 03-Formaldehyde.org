In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to perform
frozen-core Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations using
the Configuration Interaction by Perturbation of the
Single-determinant (CIPSI) algorithm in Quantum Package (QP) for the
ground state of molecules. We will use Formaldehyde as an example in
the 6-31G^* basis set.

* Running FCI calculations
** Preparing the EZFIO

 First, let's create an ~xyz~ file for Formaldehyde:

 #+begin_src text :tangle formaldehyde.xyz
4
Formaldehyde
C       0.00000000       0.00000000      -0.60298508
O       0.00000000       0.00000000       0.60539399
H       0.00000000       0.93467313      -1.18217476
H       0.00000000      -0.93467313      -1.18217476
 #+end_src

 Next, create an EZFIO database containing the geometry and the basis
 set parameters for the 6-31g* basis set:

 #+begin_src bash
qp create_ezfio -b 6-31g_star formaldehyde.xyz
 #+end_src

 This will create a directory named =formaldehyde.ezfio= in the current
 working directory, and it will be selected as the currently used EZFIO
 directory in the current shell.

 To perform a frozen-core FCI calculation using CIPSI, we first need to
 run a Hartree-Fock calculation:

 #+begin_src bash
qp run scf | tee formaldehyde.scf.out
 #+end_src

 and to freeze the core orbitals:

 #+begin_src bash
qp set_frozen_core
 #+end_src

** Running a first frozen-Core CIPSI Calculation

 Now, let's run a frozen-core CIPSI calculation using the ~qp run fci~
 command. The ~fci~ program is used to perform CIPSI calculations in
 the full configuration interaction (FCI) space.
 We will set the maximum number of determinants to 50 000 using the ~qp set determinants~ command:

 #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_det_max 50000
 #+end_src

 Next, we can run the frozen-core CIPSI calculation:

 #+begin_src bash
qp run fci | tee formaldehyde.fci1.out
 #+end_src

 This command will perform a CIPSI calculation in the full FCI space
 with Hartree-Fock orbitals and will stop when the number of
 determinants is larger than 50 000. The standard output will be saved
 to the file =formaldehyde.fci1.out=.

** Using Natural Orbitals

 We can improve the convergence of CIPSI by using natural orbitals. To
 do this, we first need to save the natural orbitals using the qp run
 save_natorb command:

 #+begin_src bash
qp run save_natorb
 #+end_src

 This will save the natural orbitals to the EZFIO database.

** Running a second frozen-Core CIPSI Calculation

 Next, we can run the frozen-core CIPSI calculation again, but this time using the natural orbitals:

 #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_det_max 1e6
qp run fci | tee formaldehyde.fci2.out
 #+end_src

 This command will perform a CIPSI calculation in the full FCI space
 using up to 1 million determinants and the natural orbitals. The
 standard output will be saved to the file formaldehyde.fci2.out.

 Congratulations! You have learned how to perform frozen-core CIPSI
 calculations using Quantum Package.

* Key points from the output files

  The output gives information about the convergence of the
  wavefunction, the energy, and the correlation energy of the system.

** Variational energy and PT2 contribution

  The output shows results at different numbers of determinants
  (~N_det~) in the wavefunction (1, 9, 21, 46, ...). For each
  ~N_det~, you can see the energy (E), the PT2 and rPT2
  corrections, and the total energy with these corrections (E+PT2 and
  E+rPT2). The PT2 and rPT2 corrections represent the second-order
  perturbation theory corrections and renormalized PT2 corrections,
  respectively.

  #+begin_example
Summary at N_det =        31824
-----------------------------------

# ============ =============================
                     State      1
# ============ =============================
# E            -114.16730139
# PT2            -0.01938121     0.00003730
# rPT2           -0.01931613     0.00003717
#
# E+PT2        -114.18668259     0.00003730
# E+rPT2       -114.18661752     0.00003717
# ============ =============================
  #+end_example

  A statistical error bar is provided as the PT2 contribution is
  computed using a stochastic algorithm.


  You can create the plots showing the convergence of the energy as a
  function of the size of the wave function. First extract the useful
  data from the output file,

  #+begin_src bash
qp_extract_cipsi_data.py formaldehyde.fci1.out > data
qp_extract_cipsi_data.py formaldehyde.fci2.out > data2
  #+end_src

  and then give the following commands to gnuplot

  #+begin_src gnuplot
set xlabel "N_{det}"
set ylabel "Energy"
set log x
plot "data"  using 1:2 with linespoints title "E(HF)", \
     "data2" using 1:2 with linespoints title "E(Nat)", \
     "data"  using 1:($2+$5) with linespoints title "E(HF)+PT2", \
     "data2" using 1:($2+$5) with linespoints title "E(Nat)+PT2"
  #+end_src

  [[./images/cipsi_econv.svg]]

  The plot indicates that the variational energy converges more
  quickly with natural orbitals compared to Hartree-Fock
  orbitals. Moreover, for large numbers of determinants, the value
  of E+PT2 is more stable, as seen from the flatter curve.



** Extrapolated energies

   This section of the output shows the minimum PT2 extrapolated
   energy for the state, with energies provided for various rPT2
   values. These values provide an estimation of the energy closer to
   the FCI limit.

  #+begin_example
Extrapolated energies
------------------------


 State            1

 =========== ===================
 minimum PT2 Extrapolated energy
 =========== ===================
    -0.0193       -114.18753808
    -0.0223       -114.18741448
    -0.0269       -114.18715515
    -0.0403       -114.18755571
    -0.0674       -114.18791213
    -0.1032       -114.18795665
    -0.1433       -114.18786737
 =========== ===================
  #+end_example

The FCI energy is estimated by making a linear fit using all the
calculations with different N_det:

\[
E_{\text{CIPSI}} (rPT2) = E + \alpha rPT2
\]

[[./images/fit_e_pt2.png]]

The extrapolated energies in the table are obtained using different
numbers of points in the fit. The first column displays the value of
the PT2 of the first point used in the extrapolation. By providing
extrapolated values with multiple points, the user can determine the
stability of the extrapolation. In this case, we can confidently state
that the extrapolated FCI value is close to -114.1875.
