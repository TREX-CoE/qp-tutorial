In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to perform
frozen-core Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations using
the Configuration Interaction by Perturbation of the
Single-determinant (CIPSI) algorithm in Quantum Package (QP) for the
ground state of molecules. We will use the dinitrogen molecule near the
equilibrium bond length, with the cc-pVDZ basis set.

* Running FCI calculations
** Preparing the EZFIO

   First, let's create a ~z-matrix~ file =n2.zmt= for dinitrogen, at a distance
   of 2.118 atomic units:

   #+begin_src text :tangle n2.zmt
n
n 1 r

r 2.118
   #+end_src

   Next, create an EZFIO database containing the geometry and the basis
   set parameters for the cc-pVDZ basis set. Specify that atomic units
   are used with the ~--au~ flag:


   #+begin_src bash
qp create_ezfio --au -b cc-pvdz n2.zmt
   #+end_src

   This will create a directory named =n2.ezfio= in the current
   working directory, and it will be selected as the currently used EZFIO
   directory in the current shell.

   To perform a frozen-core FCI calculation using CIPSI, we first need to
   run a Hartree-Fock calculation:

   #+begin_src bash
qp run scf | tee n2.scf.out
   #+end_src

   The expected HF energy is -108.949378 atomic units.
 
   Then, freeze the core orbitals:

   #+begin_src bash
qp set_frozen_core
   #+end_src

** Running a first frozen-Core CIPSI Calculation

   Now, let's run a frozen-core CIPSI calculation using the ~qp run fci~
   command. The ~fci~ program is used to perform CIPSI calculations in
   the full configuration interaction (FCI) space.
   We will set the maximum number of determinants to 50 000 using the ~qp set determinants~ command:

   #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_det_max 50000
   #+end_src

   Next, we can run the frozen-core CIPSI calculation:

   #+begin_src bash
qp run fci | tee n2.fci1.out
   #+end_src

   This command will perform a CIPSI calculation in the full FCI space
   with Hartree-Fock orbitals and will stop when the number of
   determinants is larger than 50 000. The standard output will be saved
   to the file =n2.fci1.out=.

*** Variational energy and PT2 contribution

    The output gives information about the convergence of the
    wavefunction, the energy, and the correlation energy of the system.

    The output shows results at different numbers of determinants
    (~N_det~) in the wavefunction (1, 9, 24, 50, ...). For each
    ~N_det~, you can see the energy (E), the PT2 and rPT2
    corrections, and the total energy with these corrections (E+PT2 and
    E+rPT2). The PT2 and rPT2 corrections represent the second-order
    perturbation theory corrections and renormalized PT2 corrections,
    respectively.

    #+begin_example
Summary at N_det =        52178
-----------------------------------

# ============ =============================
                     State      1
# ============ =============================
# E            -109.26874586
# PT2            -0.00944319     0.00001152
# rPT2           -0.00942889     0.00001151
#
# E+PT2        -109.27818905     0.00001152
# E+rPT2       -109.27817475     0.00001151
# ============ =============================
    #+end_example

    A statistical error bar is provided as the PT2 contribution is
    computed using a stochastic algorithm.

    You can create the plot showing the convergence of the energy as a
    function of the size of the wave function. First extract the useful
    data from the output file,

    #+begin_src bash
qp_extract_cipsi_data.py n2.fci1.out > data
    #+end_src

    and then give the following commands to Gnuplot

    #+begin_src gnuplot
set grid
set xlabel "N_{det}"
set ylabel "Energy"
set log x
plot "data"  using 1:2 with linespoints title "E", \
     "data"  using 1:($2+$3) with linespoints title "E+PT2", \
     -109.278339 title "FCI"
    #+end_src

    [[images/n2-hf.png]]

    The plot indicates that the variational energy converges to the FCI
    limit. The PT2-corrected energy is a better estimate of the FCI
    energy, but it overestimate its value.
  
*** Extrapolated FCI energy
    
    One can also plot the variational energy as a function of the
    renormalized PT2 correction as follows:

    #+begin_src gnuplot
set grid
set xlabel "E_{PT2}"
set ylabel "Energy"
unset log x
set xrange [:0.]
plot "data"  using 5:2 with linespoints title "", \
     -109.278339 title "FCI"
    #+end_src
  
    The FCI energy can be estimated by making a linear fit using all the
    calculations with different ~N_det~:

    \[
    E_{\text{CIPSI}} (rPT2) = E + \alpha rPT2
    \]

    Fitting the curve with Gnuplot over the last few points (for $|E_{\text{PT2}}| \le -0.05$), 
    one obtains a FCI estimate of -109.278 au.

    #+begin_src gnuplot
E_var(E_PT2) = a*E_PT2 + E_FCI
fit [-0.05:0.] E_var(x) "data" using 5:2 via a, E_FCI
replot E_var(x) title "Fit"
print E_FCI
    #+end_src
  
    [[images/n2-hf-fit.png]]

    The following section of the output shows the extrapolated FCI
    energy for the state, with energies provided for various rPT2
    values. 

    #+begin_example
Extrapolated energies
------------------------


 State            1

 =========== ===================
 minimum PT2 Extrapolated energy
 =========== ===================
    -0.0127       -109.27827877
    -0.0165       -109.27817215
    -0.0210       -109.27799357
    -0.0278       -109.27799584
    -0.0412       -109.27800053
    -0.0715       -109.27833983
    -0.1145       -109.27862457
 =========== ===================
    #+end_example

    The extrapolated energies in the table are obtained using different
    numbers of points in the fit. The first column displays the value of
    the PT2 of the first point used in the extrapolation. By providing
    extrapolated values with multiple points, the user can determine the
    stability of the extrapolation. In this case, we can confidently state
    that the extrapolated FCI value is close to -109.27800.

** Saving Natural Orbitals

   We can improve the convergence of CIPSI by using natural orbitals. To
   do this, we first need to save the natural orbitals:

   #+begin_src bash
qp run save_natorb
   #+end_src

   This will save the natural orbitals into the EZFIO database.

** Running a second frozen-Core CIPSI Calculation

   Next, we can run the frozen-core CIPSI calculation again, but this
   time using the natural orbitals:

   #+begin_src bash
qp run fci | tee n2.fci2.out
   #+end_src

   This command will perform a CIPSI calculation in the full FCI space
   using up to at least 50 000 determinants with the natural orbitals. The
   standard output will be saved to the file =n2.fci2.out=.

*** Variational energy and PT2 contribution

    To create the plot showing the convergence of the energy as a
    function of the size of the wave function, extract the data
    from the output file:

    #+begin_src bash
qp_extract_cipsi_data.py n2.fci2.out > data2
    #+end_src

    and then give the following commands to Gnuplot

    #+begin_src gnuplot
set grid
set xlabel "N_{det}"
set ylabel "Energy"
set log x
plot "data"  using 1:2 with linespoints title "HF : E", \
     "data2" using 1:2 with linespoints title "Nat: E", \
     "data"  using 1:($2+$3) with linespoints title "HF : E+PT2", \
     "data2" using 1:($2+$3) with linespoints title "Nat: E+PT2", \
     -109.278339 title "FCI"
    #+end_src

    [[images/n2-nat.png]]

    The plot indicates that the variational energy converges more
    quickly with natural orbitals compared to Hartree-Fock
    orbitals. 
  
*** Extrapolated FCI energy
    
    One can also compare the plots of the variational energy as a
    function of the renormalized PT2 correction:

    #+begin_src gnuplot
set grid
set xlabel "E_{PT2}"
set ylabel "Energy"
unset log x
set xrange [:0.]
plot "data"  using 5:2 with linespoints title "HF", \
     "data2" using 5:2 with linespoints title "Nat", \
     -109.278339 title "FCI"
    #+end_src
  
    Fitting the curve with Gnuplot over the last few points (for $|E_{\text{PT2}}| \le -0.05$), 
    one obtains a FCI estimate of -109.27813 au.

    #+begin_src gnuplot
E_var(E_PT2) = a*E_PT2 + E_FCI
fit [-0.05:0.] E_var(x) "data2" using 5:2 via a, E_FCI
replot E_var(x) title "Fit"
print E_FCI
    #+end_src
  
    [[images/n2-nat-fit.png]]

    #+begin_example
Extrapolated energies
------------------------


 State            1

 =========== ===================
 minimum PT2 Extrapolated energy
 =========== ===================
    -0.0086       -109.27830341
    -0.0119       -109.27824508
    -0.0159       -109.27822218
    -0.0225       -109.27815093
    -0.0341       -109.27812724
    -0.0536       -109.27822292
    -0.0870       -109.27826046
 =========== ===================
    #+end_example

    The extrapolated energies are more accurate with natural orbitals
    since the PT2 corrections are smaller: the last point is closer to
    the origin. From the data of the table, one can estimate the FCI
    energy as -109.2782(2), in agreement with the exact value of 
    -109.278339.
