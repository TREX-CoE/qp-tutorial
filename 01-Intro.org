* Introduction

  Welcome to Quantum Package (QP), an open-source environment for
  developing quantum chemistry programs. QP is designed to be
  user-friendly and easy to use, while still providing powerful tools
  for quantum chemistry calculations. In this tutorial, we will guide
  you through the basics of using QP, including setting up the
  environment, creating an EZFIO database, and running calculations.

* Environment Setup

  Before using QP, you need to set up the environment. QP requires a
  few environment variables to be set, so that it can find the
  necessary libraries and programs. Here's how you can set up the
  environment:

  #+begin_important
  1. Clone QP from https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2
  2. Install the dependencies and configure the compilation by running:

  #+begin_src bash
  ./configure -i all
  ./configure -c ./config/gfortran_avx.cfg
  source quantum_package.rc
  ninja
  #+end_src

  Note that ~$QP_ROOT~ refers to the =qp2= directory.
  #+end_important

  You can use your shell, or alternatively the QP shell to interact
  with QP. Here's how you can start the QP shell:

  #+begin_src bash
  qpsh
  #+end_src

  Now you're ready to start using QP!

* Creating an EZFIO Database

  QP stores input and output data in a database, called the /EZFIO directory/.
  To interact with the database, QP provides multiple shell functions,
  scripts, and programs. Here's how you can create an EZFIO database:

  1. Create a file with a molecular geometry in either /xyz/ or /z-matrix/ format. For example, let's create a file for the water molecule in /xyz/ format:

  #+begin_src text :tangle h2o.xyz
  3
  Water
  O       0.                     0.   0.
  H      -0.756950272703377558   0.  -0.585882234512562827
  H       0.756950272703377558   0.  -0.585882234512562827
  #+end_src

  2. Create an EZFIO database containing the geometry and the basis set parameters for the cc-pVDZ basis set:

  #+begin_src bash
  qp create_ezfio --basis=cc-pvdz h2o.xyz
  #+end_src

  A directory named =h2o.ezfio= has been created, and is selected as the
  currently used EZFIO directory in the current shell. To switch to
  another EZFIO database, use

  #+begin_src bash
  qp set_file other.ezfio
  #+end_src

  Note that when running interactively with =qpsh=, the current EZFIO
  database is displayed in the terminal prompt.

  The EZFIO database is a directory containing subdirectories. Each
  subdirectory contains files. Each data is stored in a text file:

  #+begin_src bash
$ ls h2o.ezfio/
ao_basis              davidson         mol_properties     qmcchem
ao_one_e_ints         density_for_dft  mo_one_e_ints      scf_utils
ao_two_e_erf_ints     determinants     mo_two_e_erf_ints  tc_keywords
ao_two_e_ints         dft_keywords     mo_two_e_ints      trexio
basis                 dressing         mpn                two_body_rdm
becke_numerical_grid  electrons        mu_of_r            utils
cc_utils              ezfio            nuclei             utils_cc
cipsi                 fci_tc_bi        perturbation       utils_trust_region
cipsi_tc_bi_ortho     general_mrci     pseudo             work
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src bash
$ ls h2o.ezfio/ao_basis/
ao_basis      ao_expo.gz     ao_nucl.gz   ao_prim_num.gz
ao_cartesian  ao_md5         ao_num       primitives_normalized
ao_coef.gz    ao_normalized  ao_power.gz
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src bash
$ cat h2o.ezfio/ao_basis/ao_num 
                  25
#+end_src  
  
* Running Calculations

  Now that you have an EZFIO database, you can use QP to run
  calculations. Here's how you can run a Hartree-Fock calculation:

  #+begin_src bash
qp run scf | tee h2o.scf.out
  #+end_src

  This will run the SCF program of QP and save the standard output to
  the file =h2o.scf.out=. The Hartree-Fock orbitals are stored inside
  the EZFIO database, so if you run the SCF code again, it will
  converge in a single iteration because it takes the MOs stored
  inside the database as an initial guess.

  To run a singles doubles configuration interaction (CISD)
  calculation, you can use the following commands:

  #+begin_src bash
qp set_frozen_core
qp run cisd | tee h2o.cisd.out
  #+end_src

  The ~qp set_frozen_core~ command is used to exclude the single- and
  double-excitations from the core /s/ orbitals. The output of this command
  shows that orbital ~1~ is labeled as ~Core~ and orbitals 2-24 are
  labeled as ~Active~.

  You can modify the input parameters of the programs using the
  interactive command ~qp edit~. This will open a temporary file
  filled-in with data coming from the EZFIO database. When the file is
  saved and the editor is exited, the data is saved back into the
  EZFIO.

  #+begin_note
  You can change the text editor used by qp edit by setting the
  ~EDITOR~ environment variable to the desired editor, for example, to
  use Emacs as the editor, run ~export EDITOR=emacs~ before running the
  ~qp edit~ command.
  #+end_note

  Alternatively, all the input parameters can be inspected in the
  shell using ~qp get~, for example:

  #+begin_src bash
qp get determinants n_det_max
  #+end_src

  The parameters can be set in the shell using ~qp set~, for example:

  #+begin_src bash
qp set determinants n_det_max 2000
  #+end_src

  You can use Tab-completion with the ~qp~ command, which makes the
  shell interaction more user-friendly.
